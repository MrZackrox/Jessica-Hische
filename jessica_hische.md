Jessica Hische
======

From the list that we were given one stuck out to me not because you have brought her up but because I knew a few things about her personality and I knew that she was a kick ass person. I looked through the other people a bit and looked at their work but I was still drawn towards her. I know it says in the title who I am looking at but the person I am looking at is Jessica Hische who is really an epic person as I said before. 

I have been lost in a mountine of her work for a while now and it seems like I will never be able to find a bad piece of work. Any ways Jessica Hische started to do letteringg from high school onwards but as all ways she didn’t realise that she was good and that she could do it for a living. So She was lucky as she went to the school for design were she had great lectures that pushed her and thought her what she needed to know at the time. So it wasn’t even until she was nineteen until she started to understand what graphic design was and is. This is why I like her so much it gives me hope that one day I can be able to make it as well but I know I have a long road ahead of me. 


From the beggining
------------------

At this time Hische is more of an illustrator than a letter but she still had it in her works for University. There is one project that she can pin point were she started to realise that her path was lettering. This project was for her thesis when she was a student. It was based of the Game Of Life which is a board game were you have to see how far you can get in life and you can get into funny situations. So with her idea she went for "Pack Your Baggage" which is centered around you growing up and leaving the house. The game is beautifully designed and the lettering is perfect but how did this start her journey in lettering? It started because she was a broke student at the time and didn't want to spend her last amount of money on fonts for the project so she made her own. So this is when her passion for lettering grew with many other school projects containg lettering. Even her first client was her uni which did pay her so it counted.

She created a set of posters for them about things happeing within the university, as you can see below this is one of them. 

This is the first peice that she has done sense craduating from university and this were you see Jessicas illustration style start to form. 

So at this time she is still mainly an illustrator with a tiny bit of letterering in there. You can all ready see her starting to play with the layout of the text to give it a "cooler" fell.

To get her self out there and for people to start realising that she had talent she made a set of promo card which had a Christmas theme to them. Se sent them out to a hand full of designers that the time and none apart from one got back to her. The person who got back to her was Louise Fili the renouwned graphic designer who focused on food packaging and restaurant identities. So this is were you see her passion for lettering grow exponentially as she took this oppertunity to learn all that she could, she spent all day and night working on letter for Louise. She then went home and worked one her skills by doing free lance work which helped her home in her skills.

What I like about Jessica is that she is trying to teach people about lettering and not keeping all the things that have made her sucssful to her self. I know this because I am taking part in her Skillshare class at the moment. She only has one but teaching takes time and she doesn't have much of it with being a freelance letterer and illustrator 


One Drop Cap at a Time
----------------------

One of the biggest projects that Jessica has done was a project called The Daily Drop Cap. This is where she illustrates a drop cap of her choice in any manner she seems fit. Why this is her biggest project is because is brought her into the spot light. As soon as she relised this project to the public it went viral and everyone in the design world was talking about her and the project.

With this project getting so much spot light she has got work from it and one of the more important ones was with Penguin the book company. She collaborated with the art director at Penguin Paul Buckley to make to series of twenty-six hardcover edditions of the classic literature. I don't like to think things our perfect but these are down to the finest detail as I know what type of person Jessica is. As you can see below this is some of the covers and you can see why they are perfect, the level of detail that has went into them. I unfortantly havent read any of the books so I dont get some of the quirky things that tie into the story of the book. I have looked at the Mobby-Dick cover before and never realised the detail that went into it. When I look at the Moby-Dick cover now itis obviouies that the sarifs are tails of the whale. Then you have the spear that tried to take it down which adds flare to the whole piace and completes the illustration.


Recently Jessica has worked with the amazing director Wes Anderson. I don't know is she actualy worked with him but she made the font that was used for the movie poster and even more recently she has turned it into a font which you can buy. The movies that she made it for was Moonrise Kingdom which is a fantastic movie.The movie is based in the early 60's so one of the fonts that she was looking at as Ed Benguiat's Edwardian Script and her font is loosely based on it but she went more towards the style of title fonts from Chabrol films.

As you can see below the image on the right is Ed Benguiat's Edwardian Script and the one on the left is a typical a title font from a Chabrol film. I am very glad that she went in this direction as its much cleaner and suits the film but mostly even more so the director. 

You can see below the font that she created with this inspiration and knowledge of fonts from that era. Everything about the font is perfect in my eyes but that doesn't mean much. I like all the little nuances that the each individual letter had like the letter X for some reason the line that goes through it completes it and if it wasn't there I think it would look of in some way as on side looks heavier with more twirls in the serifs 



What Do Designers bring to design?
---------------------------------

I nearly got mixed up and worte about another list of desingers that you had on the modules GitHub page. The reason that I bring this up is because I liked the question that you posed about the designers and so on. That question was what have they brought to the world of design. I have wrote about many projects that Jessica has done but the one thing that all designers and Jessica included bring the world of design is inspiration. Jessica has inspired so many people to find out what lettering is for themselfs, I know this first hand as she has helped me understand this is what I want to do an it will take time and effort but you can get there in the end.
